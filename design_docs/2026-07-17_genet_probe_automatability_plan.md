# genet-probe: shared automatability for the genet apps

**Status:** design spike (no code yet). **Crate home:** genet (engine layer),
consumed by every genet app. **Lineage:** grows out of turnstone's self-drive
harness + observation stream; sibling to
[`2026-07-15_turnstone_surfaces_in_cambium.md`](2026-07-15_turnstone_surfaces_in_cambium.md).
**Working name:** `genet-probe` (naming is Mark's call — see Open questions).

## Why

The question this answers: across the genet apps (turnstone, isometry, woodshed,
hocket), do we meet the baseline for **diagnostics, accessibility, and
instrumentality** that makes an app automatable — testable, but also legible and
drivable by scripts and models — and what would closing the gap require?

The survey (2026-07-17, against the actual repos) found a lopsided answer:

- **The substrate is shared and strong.** Every genet app is cambium-based, so
  every app emits a semantic ARIA-attributed `ScriptedDom` (`role`,
  `aria-selected`, `aria-label`, `tabindex`). genet-layout gives all of them
  `hit_test` (point -> node), `absolute_rect` (node -> rect), and
  [`a11y.rs`](../../genet/components/genet-layout/a11y.rs)'s DOM -> accesskit
  `TreeUpdate` projection. "Click the element labelled X" and "what does the
  a11y tree say" are **already answerable for any cambium app** — that is the
  whole reason turnstone's scripting is ask-the-layout, not pixel-poking.
- **The patterns are proven once and shared zero times.** The typed observation
  stream (`AppEvent` + `assert event`), the loud-and-attributable divergence
  events, and the self-drive harness (`TURNSTONE_SCENARIO`, ~20 verbs, `RESULT
  ok/fail` sentinel) all live in [turnstone/src/scenario.rs](../src/scenario.rs)
  and [observe.rs](../src/observe.rs) — app-local, ~80% generic, portable
  nowhere. isometry and woodshed have no harness at all; hocket's `-headless`
  binary is a hardcoded audio demo, not a scriptable driver.

So the move is not to build harness+diagnostics into four apps four times. It is
to **extract the generic 80% into a shared genet crate** that every cambium app
adopts through a small trait, with turnstone as the first consumer and validator.

### The per-axis picture

| Axis | turnstone | isometry | woodshed | hocket |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Semantic DOM / ARIA (cambium, shared) | yes | yes | yes | yes |
| accesskit tree (genet-layout, shared) | yes | yes | yes | yes |
| Leaf a11y (sprigging custom-paint) | partial | partial | stub | stub |
| Diagnostics (typed events + snapshot) | reference | none | none | none |
| Loud+attributable divergence | yes (07-17) | none | none | none |
| Self-drive harness | full | none | none | demo only |

## What is generic vs app-specific

The extraction lives or dies on this cut. Everything that stands on
genet-layout + the semantic DOM is generic; only what needs app-typed state or
app-specific routing crosses into the trait.

**Generic (the crate owns it):**

- The scenario-file parser and the verb dispatch loop.
- Semantic resolution: "the element with `role=tab` whose text contains `Links`"
  or "the `.list-row` containing `example.com`" -> a window-space point, via
  `absolute_rect` over the app's surfaces. This is exactly turnstone's
  `tab_center` / `row_center` / `node_center`, generalized off the specific
  panes.
- DOM asserts: `assert role <role> <label>`, `assert text <substr>`,
  `assert visible <selector>`.
- The `RESULT ok/fail` sentinel, the log, capture acknowledgment.
- The divergence convention: `interaction-missed` / `affordance-unavailable`
  emitted when a resolution finds nothing (turnstone landed this 07-17; the crate
  makes it every app's).

**App-specific (the trait `Automatable`, the small surface an app implements):**

```rust
/// One retained cambium surface the driver can search and hit-test: its DOM,
/// where it sits in the window, and the sheet it lays out under. An app with
/// several retained runners (turnstone: chrome + roster grid + gloss + trail)
/// returns one entry each; the driver resolves a selector across all of them.
pub struct ProbeSurface<'a> {
    pub name: &'static str,        // "roster", "chrome", ...
    pub dom: &'a ScriptedDom,
    pub rect: [f32; 4],            // window-space [x, y, w, h]
    pub sheet: &'a str,
}

pub trait Automatable {
    /// The hit-testable surfaces, this frame. The driver lays each out and
    /// resolves selectors against all of them — so "click-row X" needs no
    /// per-pane method, unlike turnstone today.
    fn surfaces(&self) -> Vec<ProbeSurface<'_>>;

    /// Typed observation for asserts the DOM cannot express: focus, the pane
    /// tree, a split ratio, counts. The app's existing snapshot shape.
    fn snapshot(&self) -> ProbeSnapshot;

    /// Drain the semantic events since the last call, as describe-strings
    /// (`assert event` matches substrings). The app's existing event stream.
    fn drain_events(&mut self) -> Vec<String>;

    /// Run one app-named command — the `act <label>` verb (turnstone's palette
    /// actions). `false` if no such command, so the driver fails loudly.
    fn act(&mut self, label: &str) -> bool;

    /// Deliver a synthetic pointer event at window coords. The app routes it
    /// through its own surface plan / capture (that routing is app-specific;
    /// the driver only supplies the point it resolved).
    fn press(&mut self, x: f32, y: f32);
    fn moved(&mut self, x: f32, y: f32);
    fn release(&mut self, x: f32, y: f32);
}
```

`ProbeSnapshot` starts as the small shared subset every app can answer (focused
label, a string map of named counts/flags) and grows by need; app-only asserts
can also go through `drain_events` rather than bloating the snapshot.

Note the payoff hiding in `surfaces()`: because the driver resolves a selector
across *all* retained DOMs uniformly, the extraction **simplifies** turnstone —
`tab_center`, `row_center`, `node_center`, `click_pane_row`, `click_pane_tab`,
`click_pane_node` collapse into one generic resolver. The app stops owning
per-widget geometry lookups; it just lists its surfaces.

## The verb vocabulary (shared)

Carried over from turnstone, made selector-driven so they are app-agnostic:

- `act <label>` — run an app command.
- `click <role|.class> <text>` — resolve across surfaces, press+release at the
  centre. Subsumes `click-row` / `click-tab` / `click-node`.
- `drag <from> <to>` — press, move, release (the divider gesture).
- `key <named>` / `type <text>` — keyboard.
- `assert text <substr>` / `assert role <role> <label>` — DOM asserts.
- `assert event <substr>` — the semantic event stream, including divergence.
- `assert snap <field> <op> <value>` — typed observation.
- `settle <n>` / `capture <name>` / `log <text>` — pacing, receipts.

A miss on any `click`/resolve emits `interaction-missed <selector>` into the
event stream (not just stderr), so a receipt that drives a miss fails instead of
green-lighting it — the property turnstone just proved with `rung5_divergence.scn`.

## The accessibility follow-on (separate, smaller)

The one place the accessibility baseline genuinely is not met is
**sprigging custom-paint leaves**: the graph canvas, meters, woodshed's
fretboard/chord views, hocket's waveforms mostly leave their
`fn accessibility(&mut accesskit::Node)` hook empty, so pixel-painted content is
invisible to AT and to any a11y-tree-based automation. (The graph canvas is the
partial exception — it overlays real DOM node-buttons, which is why the minimap
is already scriptable.) This is orthogonal to the harness extraction and can
land per-leaf, per-app; it belongs on each app's list, not this crate's. Flag it
here so it is not mistaken for something `genet-probe` covers.

## Sequencing

1. **Extract, with turnstone as the reference.** Lift the generic 80% of
   `scenario.rs` into `genet-probe`; leave turnstone's `Automatable` impl behind
   (its surfaces, snapshot, event drain, act, pointer routing). turnstone's
   existing scenarios must pass unchanged — that is the extraction's receipt.
   The per-pane geometry methods collapse into the shared resolver.
2. **Second consumer proves it is really generic.** Adopt in one more app —
   isometry is the natural pick (already a `data_grid` production consumer, so
   its DOM is rich). A single scenario driving isometry's grid, written against
   the shared verbs, with zero new harness code, is the proof.
3. **Diagnostics parity.** Give isometry/woodshed/hocket the small
   `Automatable` surface (snapshot + event drain). Most already have app state
   to project; the work is the adapter, not new machinery.
4. **Leaf a11y** (separate track, per app) as capacity allows.

## Open questions

- **Name.** `genet-probe` is a working handle (probe = observe + drive). Plain
  infra name by the plain-vocabulary rule; Mark's call. Alternatives:
  `genet-drive`, `genet-harness`, `genet-legible`.
- **Doc home.** This plan sits in turnstone's design_docs (reference consumer,
  established flat convention, lineage with the surfaces doc). If genet grows
  its own `design_docs/`, the crate's technical-architecture doc goes there and
  this stays the turnstone-side driver record. Cross-linked either way.
- **Snapshot shape.** Start minimal-shared and grow, or define a fuller common
  `ProbeSnapshot` up front? Lean minimal — the event stream absorbs most
  app-specific asserts, and a bloated shared snapshot is a coupling smell.
- **Scope of `act`.** turnstone's `act` runs palette actions. Is "run a named
  command" the right universal verb, or should the driver reach app intents more
  structurally? Palette-label is stringly-typed but matches how a human or model
  would name the action, which is the automatability goal.

## Finding: a widget is only genet-probe-resolvable if its identity is in the DOM

Wiring turnstone's first verb surfaced the sharp edge of the whole idea. The
resolver can only find what the **semantic DOM** carries — a selectable class
(or role) plus the target text reachable as the element's own text or its
`aria-label`. Against turnstone's four widget shapes:

- **Tab strip** — resolvable. `.tab` with the label as direct child text. Wired.
- **Sectioned list (Trail)** — resolvable. `.list-row` with direct child text.
  Ready to wire.
- **data_grid (Roster rows)** — resolvable after a two-line fix (done). The
  clickable cell was a classless inline `<span>`; giving it a class (`roster-cell`,
  targeting only) and making it a block `<div>` fixes two things at once: the
  resolver's `absolute_rect` returns a box for a block but not an inline run, and
  a block fills the cell width so the resolved *centre* lands on the clickable
  rather than in empty space past short left-aligned text. This is the widget
  lesson in miniature: **a genet-probe target must be a block-level element with
  a class and reachable text** — inline text is neither hit-testable-by-centre
  nor box-resolvable. The fix was turnstone-side (the cell content is turnstone's
  closure, not cambium's), so no cambium change was needed.
- **graph-canvas node (Gloss)** — resolvable after a cambium change (done). The
  scenario targets a node by **url**, and two nodes can share a display label
  (two pages both titled "Example Domain"), so the label is not enough. The fix
  is the general one: `GraphCanvasNode.key: Option<String>`, emitted as
  `data-key` on the node button, plus `Selector::with_attr` in genet-probe to
  select on it. turnstone sets `key = url`. This is the first case that needed a
  cambium touch (the others were turnstone-side), and it is the same lesson
  again — a target is findable only through identity the DOM carries — now
  extended from "class + text" to "a stable key attribute" for the
  ambiguous-label case.

This is the automatability baseline made concrete at the widget level: **an app
is drivable exactly to the extent its targetable identity lives in the semantic
DOM.** It sharpens the accessibility axis too — the same DOM identity a driver
needs is what an AT tool reads. So the follow-on is not just "wire the other
verbs"; it is "put the missing identity in the DOM," which is a cambium/app fix
each of those two widgets wants regardless.

## Progress

- 2026-07-17 — Spike written. Prior same-session groundwork that makes this
  cheap: turnstone's divergence events landed (`94d685a`), and the four catalog
  components this crate's verbs resolve against (tab strip, split, sectioned
  list, the graph-canvas leaf) are all in cambium with ARIA semantics.
- 2026-07-17 — **Slice 1: resolver founded** in genet (`genet-probe`,
  `ProbeSurface` + `Selector` + `resolve` + `text_present`, 5 tests, MIT/Apache).
  Proven to resolve within turnstone's dependency graph via the local patch (genet
  main is 12 commits ahead of origin with foreign work, so `genet-probe` is NOT
  yet on origin/main — a clean turnstone checkout needs it pushed there; deferred,
  not forced with foreign commits in the way).
- 2026-07-17 — **Slice 2: turnstone drives click-tab AND click-row through
  genet-probe.** `tab_center` (Roster) and `row_center` (Trail) collapsed to
  3-line `resolve` delegations; `click-row` resolves a Trail `.list-row` and a
  grid `.roster-cell` through one path, and — resolving off the DOM rather than
  graph truth — the Roster's non-Nodes-tab guard fell away for free (no row
  spans are drawn, so nothing resolves). The grid cell went inline-span ->
  block-div (the finding above). Unit tests + the roster, trail, and divergence
  scenarios green through the shared crate.
- 2026-07-17 — **Slice 3: click-node too — all three interaction verbs now
  resolve through genet-probe.** Needed the session's first cambium touch:
  `GraphCanvasNode.key` -> `data-key` (cambium `fd57c2d5`) and
  `Selector::with_attr` (genet `5f735354`), so a node is targeted by its url
  where its label is not unique. `GlossPane::node_center`'s projection-plus-leaf
  math collapsed to the same `resolve` delegation (the node button is a real
  positioned element; `absolute_rect` already knows where it is). The gloss
  scenario is RESULT ok. **Turnstone's three interaction verbs — click-tab,
  click-row, click-node — are now one shared path over one substrate.**

- 2026-07-18 — **Slice 4: the `Automatable` trait, and turnstone implements it.**
  Crate-side first (genet `5844cede`): the trait plus `AutomatableExt`'s provided
  `resolve` / `click`, so an app that supplies the small surface gets the driving
  verbs for free. Then the real consumer immediately **corrected the abstract
  shape**: turnstone's pane DOMs are `Rc<RefCell<ScriptedDom>>`, so
  `surfaces() -> Vec<ProbeSurface>` could not compile (the `Ref` guards would
  drop), and it became a **visitor**, `with_surfaces(&self, f)`, where the guards
  live for the callback. This is the plan's "add the trait as consumers pull it"
  working exactly as intended — the mock held a plain DOM and hid the borrow; the
  first real impl found it. `Shell` now implements the trait, and the three
  `click_pane_*` methods collapsed onto `self.click(sel)` (all-surface resolution,
  no per-pane dispatch). 69 tests + the roster/trail/gloss/divergence scenarios
  green through the trait.

- 2026-07-18 — **Slice 5: the shared scenario driver** (genet `382dd17`). The
  parser + verb loop lifted off turnstone into genet-probe: `Scenario::parse` reads
  a generic grammar, `Scenario::tick(app)` drives an [`Automatable`] app one step
  per frame (the app keeps its winit pump), and the two things the loop cannot do
  itself sit behind a `Driveable` trait — `capture` (a screenshot) and `app_step`
  (any app-specific verb, e.g. `assert pane roster`, passed through raw). Generic
  verbs are shared: `act`, `click` by selector, `settle`, `assert text` / `event`
  / `snap`, `log`, `capture`. A `click` miss attributes itself into the event
  stream as `interaction-missed <selector>` — the divergence rule, generalized
  off turnstone into the loop. 11 crate-side tests over a mock `Driveable`.

## The two flags — RESOLVED 2026-07-18

Both flags (the grammar convergence and the turnstone migration) turned out to be
**one question**, because the sibling's Piccolo runner (`401d21f`) is not a rival
loop — it is a `script` *step* inside turnstone's own grammar. So there were only
ever two loops to reconcile: turnstone's `scenario.rs` and `genet_probe::Scenario`.
The resolution: **prove they are one loop by driving the real Shell with the
shared driver**, rather than rip out turnstone's mature, receipt-critical,
actively-developed harness mid-flight.

Landed (turnstone, this session): `Shell` implements `genet_probe::Driveable`
(`capture` + `app_step`), a `TURNSTONE_SHARED_SCENARIO` activation runs
`genet_probe::Scenario` against the real Shell in the winit pump (additive — it
does not touch `scenario.rs`, so no collision with the Piccolo work), and
`snapshot()` grew `panes` / `surfaces` fields so a generic scenario can assert app
state without an app verb. `shared_driver.scn` is **RESULT ok** headed: it opens
a pane (`act` -> `Automatable::act`), asserts state (`assert snap`/`text`), clicks
a tab by selector (the shared resolver + `Automatable::press`), and drives a miss
that attributes itself as an assertable `interaction-missed` event — with one
app-specific verb (`key escape`) flowing through `app_step` to prove that seam
too. The convergence is now demonstrated, not asserted: **one loop, driving the
real app.**

Remaining (a de-risked mechanical follow-on, now that the seam is proven):

- **Contributed-pane geometry and identity** — T5a exposes provider-owned DOMs
  and their complete stylesheets through `with_surfaces`, but Probe still lays
  those surfaces out without the pane's retained scroll offset and names every
  contributed pane alike. Carry scroll and stable pane identity before a
  scenario targets below-fold controls or one of several contributed panes.
- **Manual assistive-technology receipt** — contributed provider DOMs now join
  Turnstone's AccessKit tree through a provider-neutral projection, and T5a
  asserts Sky semantics through that tree. A manual Narrator walk remains the
  honest gate for claiming screen-reader coverage of a registered surface.
- **Full retirement of `scenario.rs`'s loop** — re-home its remaining ~28
  app-specific verbs (the asserts, drag/dropfile, divider, the omnibar verbs, and
  the Piccolo `script` step) into `Driveable::app_step`, then delete the
  duplicated parser/loop/sentinel. Coordinate with whoever owns the Piccolo
  runner, since `script` is theirs; the path is validated, so this is moving
  handlers, not designing.
- **Second consumer (isometry)** — the driver now has a proven real consumer
  (turnstone); isometry is the proof it is *generic*: a fresh app implementing
  `Driveable`, driven by a scenario with zero new harness code.
