# Gloss as a composite pane; the swatch as a customizable projection

## Current direction, 2026-09-29

**Accepted by Mark:** Gloss becomes the configurable operational overview as well
as the navigation overview. Compose downloads, background work, sync and items
needing attention alongside the minimap and optional history summaries. Trail
retains browsing history, recall and recovery. Steward's implemented download
readouts now compose in Gloss; the separate pane is retired in source. Background
work, sync and actionable operation controls remain later product-owned work.

Shared diagnostic observations belong in `mere-apparatus`; the canonical contract
and ownership ruling live at
`mere/design_docs/mere_docs/implementation_strategy/2026-06-08_system_diagnostics_and_accessibility_plan.md`.
Turnstone still owns operations, permissions, completion and actionable controls.
Inspector takes the former Apparatus pane's object analysis alongside document
inspection, metadata and clipping. Its existing graph facets, provenance and
handling controls retain their product-owned write paths. The migration is written
and the redundant pane is retired; the bounded migration is qualified below.
Inspection of a selection within a document is an accepted later capability,
separate from the document-level facts and handling controls migrated here.

**Implementation, 2026-09-29:** Downloads is a registered read-only section,
projected from the same durable graph facets Steward used. A newly summoned Gloss
starts with the minimap and Downloads, per Mark's default ruling; remove, add,
reorder and persistence use the existing per-leaf composition path. Older Gloss
configurations retain their chosen sections.

Inspector now hosts the viewer radio and live document capability/zoom readouts
alongside its existing document, classification and provenance sections. Viewer
writes carry the member resolved by that Inspector's followed context rather than
the runtime pool's cursor. Turnstone retains the existing `SetViewerOverride`
write and respawn path.

The independent Steward and object-analysis Apparatus panes are retired from
runtime variants, registration, commands and renderer caches. Real saved
`frame.json` / `windows.json` leaves deserialize in place: Steward becomes Gloss
with Downloads, Apparatus becomes Inspector. Pane ids, graph bindings, splits,
ratios and closed lens slots are retained; the next save emits current names.
`src/panes/saved_content.rs` contains only this read-boundary conversion.

**Qualified, 2026-09-29:** the [September 29 qualification receipt](2026-09-29_shared_diagnostics_gloss_inspector_receipt.md)
records the locked, offline workspace gate (612 passed, 9 ignored), five exact
Piccolo/Wasm author/watch/admitted-ring tests, 33 UI/Inspector regressions and the
normal default-feature native build. Fresh and restarted
`gloss_inspector_migration.scn` and `gloss_inspector_migration_restore.scn`
scenarios both returned `RESULT ok`; three nonblank
1024×600 captures were reviewed. Gloss's configured Downloads/Recent order,
Inspector and the requested `genet.reader` viewer survived restart. Deliberately
small diagnostic limits exposed eviction and a gap on the initial run; the
restored run stayed within bounds without loss.
`smolweb_download.scn` now observes Gloss; its TLS/download fixture remains a
separate acceptance gate. Background jobs, sync controls and within-document
selection inspection retain their existing later implementation scope. Downloads
rows are inert; extend section actions only when real product controls require it.
Custom-leaf semantic parity, full built-in pane owner selectors, document
selection semantics, exact presented-frame correlation and human AT remain open.

## Original design and implementation history

2026-07-20, Mark's ask (during the recycle-bin work): "at base it's a
minimap, but if you wanted to you could put sections from other panes in
there too (like recent nodes, or deleted)" — and the swatch itself "can and
should be customizable... must consider the UI for this." Ruled POSSIBLE;
this note records the shape so the build starts from it. Design capture
only; nothing here is implemented.

## Why it is structurally cheap

Both halves already exist as the right kind of pieces:

- **Sections are already the currency.** Trail is a `sectioned_list` over
  neutral `ListSection`s, and every pane's content is gathered by a pure
  `fn(&App) -> rows` (trail_rows, the roster gather, the recycle bin's
  removed-derive). Naming these — a **section-provider registry**, id →
  gather — makes any list section composable into any pane. The providers
  are the functions we already have.
- **The swatch is already a projection.** The Gloss minimap is a sprigging
  custom-paint leaf over a cartography projection of the graph. "Customizable
  swatch" = the projection's parameters (color-by, filter, emphasis, layout
  source) become a named preset the pane config carries — the register-lens /
  cartography vocabulary, not new machinery.

## The shape

- `GlossConfig { sections: Vec<SectionId>, swatch: ProjectionPreset }` —
  ordered, the swatch being section zero by default.
- **Config lives ON THE FRISKET LEAF** (arrangement truth): it persists with
  `frame.json`, tears out with the pane, differs per lens window, and needs
  no sidecar. Precedent: `PaneContent::Tile(uuid)` already carries data.
  Likely `PaneContent::Gloss(GlossConfig)` with serde defaults so old
  layouts load.
- Composition generalizes: if it proves out on Gloss, ANY list pane can host
  foreign sections (Trail's Removed inside Gloss, a roster bucket beside the
  minimap). Gloss is the pilot because its identity ("the navigator") is
  additive, not replaced.

## The UI question (the real work, per Mark)

Candidates, not yet chosen:

1. **Right-click the pane → config actions in the palette** ("Gloss: add
   section — Recent", "Gloss: remove section — Removed"). Rides the
   just-landed right-click palette; zero new chrome. Weakness: invisible
   affordance.
2. **An edit mode on the pane** (a small ⚙ row when the pane is active):
   in-place add/remove/reorder rows. Needs the pane-header furniture panes
   deliberately don't have yet.
3. **Drag a section header from one pane into another** (the tile-drag
   grammar applied to sections). The most direct manipulation, the most
   gesture work; fits the tear-out family long-term.

Recommendation when built: start with (1) — it is spine-honest, receipt-
drivable, and teaches the palette scoping we already want; grow (3) once
section headers are draggable objects. NOT Apparatus: pane composition is
arrangement/view state, not graph-object metadata (the taxonomy holds).

## Prerequisites

- The section-provider registry (extract the existing gathers behind ids).
- `PaneContent::Gloss` grows its config (serde-defaulted).
- Palette actions scoped to the active pane (the registry's category reread
  the harvest doc already earmarks).

## Progress

- **2026-07-21 (the preset half LANDED — turnstone `b02025c`):**
  `src/swatch_pane.rs` is the vocabulary: `ProjectionPreset` (id, label,
  leaf key, component knobs, one pure `gather: fn(&App) -> SwatchModel`) and
  the one retained `SwatchPane` over any preset. Activation rides each node
  as DATA (`SwatchActivate::Open/Switch`), so presets need no handler code
  and the shell lowers every variant through the spine. Gloss + the Overmap
  are now `GLOSS_MINIMAP` / `OVERMAP_LINEAGE` preset consts of the one pane;
  receipts re-ran green (rung5_gloss's `click-node` proves the probe contract
  survived the refactor). Riding along: cambium's swatch grew `with_expand` /
  `with_node_labels` knobs (the overmap labels its sessions), and pane
  pointer-move routing landed (`deliver_hover` — the hover emphasis the
  component always supported now lights up). **Remaining**: the sections half
  (the provider registry, `PaneContent::Gloss(GlossConfig)`, and the UI
  question above — untouched, still the real work).

- **2026-07-22 (the sections half, slice 1 LANDED — turnstone `151b416`):**
  `src/sections.rs` is the section-provider registry: `SectionProvider` (id,
  title, a pure `gather: fn(&App) -> Vec<SectionRow>` — the same currency as a
  preset's `gather`, the seam the swatch half left), with `RECENT_SECTION` /
  `REMOVED_SECTION` (the Trail's Recent/Removed gathers, now composable) and
  `by_id` lookup. `ProjectionPreset` grew a `sections: &[SectionProvider]`
  field: `GLOSS_MINIMAP` composes `[REMOVED]` (deleted nodes are gone from the
  graph, so the minimap is where you look for them), the Overmap composes none
  (it fills). The swatch shrinks to the top `SWATCH_FRACTION` and the sections
  stack below in a scrollable column; `swatch_view` renders title + rows,
  inert display. Receipt `rung5_gloss_composite.scn` headed ok (the Removed
  row shows under the minimap after a delete); `rung5_gloss` re-run green (the
  `click-node` probe survived the swatch shrink). The registry test caught a
  real semantic: the Removed section filters by ORIGINAL node id, so a plain
  open (new id) does not clear it — only recover (which restores the id) does.
  **Remaining (slices 2+):** a section row's click (a Recent row navigates, a
  Removed row recovers — the swatch's `resolve`/probe contract extended to the
  section rows); the per-frisket-leaf config (`PaneContent::Gloss(GlossConfig)`
  so a pane chooses its sections, persisted with `frame.json`); and the
  add/remove UI (the right-click palette scoped to the active pane).

- **2026-07-22 (the sections half FINISHED — turnstone `4afed14`):** all three
  remaining slices.
  - **Rows are live.** `SectionRow` carries a `SectionActivate` (Open /
    Recover) as DATA, like a swatch node's, so a provider declares what its
    rows mean and needs no handler code. Recent navigates; Removed recovers by
    ORIGINAL id (the recycle bin's identity contract — the Trail and the Gloss
    agree). Rows wear a `section-row` class and `click_pane_row` learned it, so
    one verb addresses a composed row wherever it was composed. (The first
    headed run missed exactly there; the selector was the fix.)
  - **Composition rides the leaf.** `PaneContent::Gloss(GlossConfig)` carries
    provider ids, so a pane's composition persists with `frame.json`, travels
    on tear-out, and differs per lens window. Sections moved off
    `ProjectionPreset` (slice 1's hardcode) to the pane instance:
    `sections::resolve` maps the leaf's ids to providers each frame, SKIPPING
    unknown ids so a newer build's config degrades instead of failing, and
    `SwatchPane::set_sections` hands them over. frisket grew
    `content_mut(pane_id)` — the seam for editing a leaf's own config in place.
    The unit→tuple variant change is the deliberate no-legacy-friction cut
    (DOC_POLICY §3): a pre-`GlossConfig` layout resets to default, logged.
  - **Add/remove is pane-scoped palette rows.** While a Gloss is active the
    palette offers `Gloss: add/remove section — <Title>` per provider;
    `Action::TogglePaneSection` edits that leaf and persists. Rings as `Panes`
    (composition edits the layout, not a node). At base a Gloss is a bare
    minimap — you compose it.
  - Receipt `rung5_gloss_composite.scn` headed ok end to end: bare minimap →
    compose Removed → click the row to recover by original id → toggle back to
    bare. 107 unit tests.

  **What this generalizes to (not built):** the registry is pane-agnostic, so
  any list pane could host foreign sections — the design's original "Trail's
  Removed inside Gloss, a roster bucket beside the minimap". Only Gloss reads a
  config today. Also open: section ORDER (config order is honoured but there is
  no reorder affordance), and the drag-a-section-header gesture (UI candidate 3,
  which wants draggable section headers first).

- **2026-07-23 (the open bits: reorder + the roster bucket):** two of the three
  items above.
  - **Reorder.** `Action::MovePaneSection { pane, section, delta }` moves a
    section within its pane's stack. Composition order IS the config's order, so
    a reorder is the same leaf edit as add/remove: same clamped-in-bounds rule,
    same `SaveSession`, same `Panes` ring. It clamps at the ends rather than
    wrapping, because a stack has a top and a bottom and a silent wrap would
    read as a bug. The palette only offers a move that would do something (no
    rows at all with one section, no "up" on the first), so every offered row
    changes the pane. A no-op move reports nothing, which keeps the receipt
    honest: `pane-section-moved` fires only on a real move.
  - **The Nodes provider.** `NODES_SECTION` gathers the graph's nodes,
    most-recently-visited first, capped at 8. This is Mark's own example ("a
    roster bucket beside the minimap"): a section borrowed from a pane the
    Gloss is not. It cost one `fn(&App) -> Vec<SectionRow>` and one line in
    `ALL`, which is the registry paying off as designed.
  - Receipt `rung5_gloss_composite.scn` extended end to end: compose Removed,
    recover from it, compose Nodes beside it, move Nodes up, then remove both
    back to the bare minimap.

- **2026-07-23 (the host side GENERALIZES — the third open bit):** composition
  is now a property of a PANE, not of the Gloss.
  - `GlossConfig` became **`PaneComposition`**, and `PaneContent::Overmap` grew
    one. `PaneContent::composition()` / `composition_mut()` are the single place
    that answers "does this pane compose?", so gaining a host is a variant
    listed there rather than another match spread through the host.
  - The Overmap was the honest second host because it already renders through
    the SAME `SwatchPane`: it cost a `sections::resolve` and a `set_sections` in
    its render arm, no renderer work at all. That is the swatch-half author's
    seam paying off twice.
  - `pane_section_actions` is written against `composition()` rather than a pane
    kind, and its row prefix is the pane's own tag, title-cased. So the Overmap
    named itself ("Overmap: add section — Removed") with no second table, and
    the Gloss's existing labels stayed byte-identical (the older receipt still
    passes unchanged).
  - Worth stating because it looks like a contradiction: the Overmap is
    window-chrome (`follows_active_graph() == false`) while its composed
    sections read ACTIVE-GRAPH truth. That is consistent. A section gathers from
    app state each frame; `follows_active_graph` governs whether the host
    retags the LEAF's `graph_id`, which sections never consult.
  - Receipt `overmap_composite.scn` headed ok: base swatch, compose Removed,
    compose Nodes, reorder, then click the composed Removed row to recover the
    node by its ORIGINAL id from inside the Overmap. 109 unit tests + frisket's
    17.

  **The drag gesture stays deferred, with a reason.** Turnstone already has a
  full tab-drag grammar (`WorkbenchStackOnto`, `WorkbenchSplitBeside`,
  `TearOutTile`), but it lives in the WORKBENCH lane and is tile-shaped. A
  section-header drag would either duplicate that machinery inside the swatch
  pane or wait for it to be generalized into a shared "drag an object between
  panes" lane. Duplicating it is the mistake the component catalog exists to
  prevent, so this waits on the generalization rather than growing a second
  bespoke drag lane. The cheap half (headers as identified, hit-testable
  objects) is already there in spirit: rows wear `section-row` and the resolver
  knows it, so a header class is a small step whenever the lane arrives.
