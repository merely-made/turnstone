# The recycle bin: node deletion through eidetic + athanor

2026-07-20, with Mark. How "forget this page" works in turnstone: stage the
removed node in the memory subsystem, recover it with its identity intact,
and let athanor (the oven) permanently forget it later, on command or
schedule, baking an engram on the way out.

This resumes work meerkat already did and turnstone forgot. It extends the
[Alembic implementation plan](../../mere/design_docs/mere_docs/implementation_strategy/2026-06-24_alembic_implementation_plan.md)
(slice D, Athanor) and the deleted-node bin it names.

## The decision (and the dead ends behind it)

Delete must be recoverable, and recovery must restore the SAME node, not a
stranger that happens to share a url. Three approaches were tried and rejected
before this one, each recorded so the reasoning survives:

1. **App-side tombstone list + a `tombstones` sidecar.** Rejected: invented
   turnstone state that leverages none of the stack, plus a sidecar. (Mark: "no
   tombstones", "no dang sidecars".)
2. **Derive "removed" from the graph's navigation memory** (remembered but
   absent). Stack-native, but recovery mints a NEW uuid, so edges/identity are
   lost and the derivation papers over the resulting duplicate by url. (Mark:
   "recover the node with its original uuid.")
3. **A first-class `Node.removed` soft-delete flag** in the kernel. Preserves
   identity, but the marker's home is the memory subsystem, not the node.
   (Mark: "Eidetic/athanor make sense to me.")

The chosen model: the bin lives in **eidetic**; the oven is **athanor**.

## The mechanism already exists

`eidetic::deleted` (eidetic-core/src/deleted.rs) IS the recycle bin:

- `DeletedNode { node_id, url, title, tags, graph_id, deleted_at_ms }` —
  captures the kernel uuid, so recovery can restore the original identity.
- `record_deleted(store, &DeletedNode) -> ManifestId` — stage into the bin.
- `list_deleted(store) -> Vec<DeletedNode>` — read the bin.

meerkat wired this in `node_ops.rs` (`record_deleted` / `list_deleted` +
`run_forgetting_pass`) over an eidetic store opened in `main.rs`. It died with
meerkat; turnstone never re-derived it. There is no `purge` / `restore` in the
API by design: the bin is append-only, and "still deleted" is `list_deleted`
MINUS the nodes currently present in the graph — a recovered node reappears in
the graph and drops off the list on its own.

## The slices

### Slice 1 — the eidetic store, as an async port
turnstone opens an `eidetic_fjall::FjallStore` at the session dir
(`sessions/<id>/bin/`), behind an armillary actor, mirroring the fetch port:
`Effect::{RecordDeleted, ListDeleted}` -> actor command -> `Update::DeletedListed`.
`record_deleted` / `list_deleted` are async; nothing blocks the render thread
(the Alembic plan's "async, never synchronous on render" rule for athanor).

### Slice 2 — delete, recycle, recover
- **Delete** (`Action::DeleteFocusedNode`, Del key + palette): build a
  `DeletedNode` from the focused node (uuid, url, title, tags, session graph
  id, now-ms), `record_deleted` it (Effect), then remove the node from the
  graph. Close its content session and workbench tile.
- **The Removed section** (Trail, later a dedicated Recycle view): the cached
  `list_deleted` result minus nodes currently in the graph.
- **Recover**: re-mint from the `DeletedNode` record. Restoring the ORIGINAL
  uuid (not `canvas::recover_node`'s fresh-mint) is the refinement — it needs a
  canvas `recover_with_id(uuid, url, title, tags)`. Edges are not restored
  (they left with the node); full-subgraph capture is a later fidelity step.

### Slice 3 — the oven
athanor's forgetting pass permanently drops staged records and bakes an engram
on the way out (distill before forget), on command ("empty the bin") or the
steady-heat schedule. Config knobs land in Apparatus, live passes in Steward
(the Alembic plan's §8 answer).

**The on-command half LANDED 2026-07-21/22** (mere `df316b6` + turnstone
`94c3043`):

- mere `df316b6`: `eidetic::deleted` grew its deletion door — the append-only
  bin had no way out. `purge_deleted(node_id)` drops a node's tombstone(s)
  (`list_typed` -> `delete_manifest`, all matching since a node deleted twice
  has two); `clear_deleted` empties the bin. Both return real counts, both
  idempotent on an empty/absent bin. 3 tests, landed in isolation while the
  wider tree was transiently red on a concurrent cartography refactor
  (eidetic-core is independent of it).
- turnstone `94c3043` (committed forward by the concurrent projection-proof
  session): `BinCommand::Empty` -> `clear_deleted` -> the refreshed (empty)
  list; `Action::EmptyRecycleBin` (palette "Empty recycle bin") lowers
  `Effect::EmptyRecycleBin` only when the bin is non-empty (no placebo), and
  the `recycle-bin-emptied` event carries the count. Receipt
  `rung6_delete_recover.scn` grew a third leg (delete -> Removed -> empty ->
  Removed gone, record forgotten from the STORE, not just derived away);
  headed RESULT ok, 88 unit tests green.

**The retirement pass LANDED 2026-07-22** (mere `499b071` + turnstone `232f188`):
athanor's third pass, beside forgetting (content) and consolidation (engrams).
`propose_retirement(deleted, keep_ms, now_ms)` names the tombstone ids past the
retention window (pure, R0 — a "what will be forgotten" preview is possible);
`apply_retirement` purges them via `purge_deleted`. The bin actor's
`retire_then_list` runs it on each session open (spawn + Reopen), a 30-day
window (a named const; the Apparatus knob is the config follow-on),
best-effort (a failed retire logs and still lists). 2 athanor tests green in
isolation; the existing receipt re-run green (the window never fires in a
seconds-long run).

**Remaining (the oven's last halves):**
- The **continuous background timer** — retirement fires at session open now,
  not on a clock. The true steady-heat is an armillary actor self-ticking; the
  design's "background daemon" shape.
- The **engram bake** (distill a staged node before forgetting). Open design:
  a single tombstone (url/title/tags) is thin for a graph engram, so this may
  be a per-empty-batch distillation ("forgotten pages" engram) rather than
  per-node. Needs a design pass before building.
- **Per-item "delete permanently"** — a Removed-row affordance over
  `purge_deleted` (the lib fn is landed; its port command waits for the UI).
- **The config surface** — the retention knob in Apparatus, live passes in
  Steward (the Alembic plan's §8 answer).

## Status

Design locked 2026-07-20; slices 1+2 LANDED the same day.

- mere 370a148: `canvas::recover_node` takes the record's uuid and re-mints
  under it (`mint_node_as` over `GraphDelta::AddNode`'s existing id param);
  idempotent (an existing id selects, never twins).
- turnstone: `recycle.rs` is the bin port — an armillary actor
  (`spawn_named("recycle-bin")`) over `eidetic_fjall::FjallStore` at
  `sessions/<id>/bin`, store ops under pollster (serial disk IO, no
  runtime). It answers every command AND its own spawn with the refreshed
  list (`Update::BinListed` replaces `App::removed` wholesale); failures are
  `Update::BinFailed` -> the `bin-failed` event, never a silent empty list.
  A session switch re-points it (`BinCommand::Reopen`) before the adopted
  session's effects run. Delete builds the record off the living node and
  stages it (`Effect::RecordDeleted`); the Trail's Removed section derives
  bin-minus-present (newest per id) and its rows read as the affordance
  ("Recover example.com/" — a Removed row must not read identically to the
  url's Recent row, or text-addressed clicks and screen readers cannot tell
  navigate from recover); a click lowers `Action::RecoverDeletedNode(uuid)`.
- Receipts: `rung6_delete_recover.scn` headed RESULT ok (delete -> staged ->
  identity recover -> Removed derives away, record still staged); 85 unit
  tests incl. the app-level bin round trip and the canvas identity test.
- The tombstone dead-end's remnants (an origin merge re-landed them) were
  replaced by this in the same change.

Slice 3 (athanor's pass: permanent forget + engram bake, "empty the bin" +
steady-heat schedule, knobs in Apparatus / passes in Steward) is next.

2026-09-06: the [page lifecycle plan](2026-09-06_page_lifecycle_plan.md) extends the record to carry a node's capture
envelopes and restores them on recovery (L4, phase L-P2), and gives
athanor's retirement pass blob reaping over a reference set of living
envelopes, surviving tombstones and download facets (L-P3).
