# Pane Registry, Graph Views, and Shell Composition Plan

**Date**: 2026-08-08

**Status**: A0, A1 and A6 complete and verified. Lanes open: **A2** and
**A7**; **A3** is gated on A2; **A4** and **A5** are held until A2/A3 report
what the tree must carry.

The Shared Knot seam that blocked A1's verification cleared on its own; the
concurrent lane landed the five reader exports. A second, unrelated blocker
appeared and is worth recording because Git cannot see it: a machine-local
`.cargo/config.toml` path override still named `mere/crates/persona/personae`
after that crate moved to `crates/dramatis`. Thirty-eight of thirty-nine
overrides were correct, which is how a silent patch bypass hides, and the
file is gitignored, so no commit repairs it for the next machine.

**Scope**: Make pane instances independent, restore real multi-graph composition,
generalize the window layout, and make the shell configurable without collapsing
graph truth, Workbench arrangement, pane layout, and chrome into one model.

The short ruling:

- A window is a **space** containing panes. It is not owned by one graph.
- A graph runtime owns graph truth. A Forme runtime owns arrangement and physics.
  A **Graph pane** is a view onto both.
- A **Workbench** is a durable arrangement of opened graph members, hosted in a pane.
- A pane may publish graph, member, session, or application context for followers.
- The **shell** owns commands, navigation, focus, notifications, and transcript data.
  **Chrome** is the configurable projection of those services into a space.
- Tiled containers are recursive. Floating panes are a sibling layer above the tiled
  root. Tear-out moves the same pane instance into another space.
- Roster, Inspector, Apparatus, Trail, Alembic, Steward, Comms, Gloss, Overmap,
  Publishing, and Settings keep their separate meanings.

## 1. Prior decisions this plan carries forward

| Source | Durable decision | Consequence here |
| --- | --- | --- |
| [Multi-Graph Activation](../../mere/design_docs/mere_docs/implementation_strategy/2026-06-09_multi_graph_activation_plan.md) and the archived [Window Composition Plan](../../mere/design_docs/archive_docs/2026-06-19_completed_plans/2026-06-11_window_composition_plan.md) | Graph authorities are pooled by `GraphId`; panes resolve through their own graph binding; one window may contain panes from different graphs. | Turnstone restores this model instead of extending its current single `App::canvas`. |
| [Rung 5 Panes](2026-07-14_turnstone_rung5_panes_plan.md) | The window pane tree and Platen Workbench nest because they arrange different identities. | They may share a topology algebra, while pane identity and member identity remain distinct. |
| [Surfaces in Cambium](2026-07-15_turnstone_surfaces_in_cambium.md) | Cambium owns the furniture inside a pane rect; Turnstone owns rects, mixed surfaces, routing, and composition. | `cambium::frisket` does not become Turnstone's outer renderer. |
| [Gloss Composite Pane](2026-07-20_gloss_composite_pane.md) | Composition is per pane instance and travels with it. | `PaneConfig` remains instance state; the registry does not absorb it into pane-kind globals. |
| [Frisket Direction](../../genet/docs/2026-07-24_frisket_pane_component_direction.md) | `genet-host-api::TileTree` is presentation vocabulary; hosts remain authoritative. Turnstone's mixed-surface presenter deliberately differs from the DOM presenter. | Reuse of `TileTree` is proof-gated and does not imply adopting the Cambium DOM view. |
| [Overmap](../../mere/design_docs/mere_docs/implementation_strategy/2026-07-20_overmap_sessions_graph_plan.md) | Overmap derives a session graph from manifests and lineage. | A multi-graph space changes focus and composition, not Overmap's underlying truth. |
| [Configuration Ownership](../../mere/design_docs/mere_docs/implementation_strategy/2026-08-06_configuration_ownership_settings_projection_plan.md) | The configured product owns typed storage; providers describe; Cambium renders; hosts apply. | `SettingsRef` is a pane source, not a graph-binding policy or a universal settings store. |

The external donors agree on the broad shape:

- [Rerun Blueprints](https://rerun.io/docs/concepts/visualization/blueprints)
  separate recorded truth from saved view hierarchy and per-view configuration.
- [`egui_tiles`](https://docs.rs/egui_tiles/latest/egui_tiles/) uses one recursive,
  app-payload-generic tree with explicit
  [container cleanup policy](https://docs.rs/egui_tiles/latest/egui_tiles/struct.SimplificationOptions.html).
- [Zellij layouts](https://zellij.dev/documentation/creating-a-layout.html) treat
  tiled panes, stacked panes, floats, chrome choices, and named layouts as data.

They are donors, not replacement ontologies:

| Donor | Take | Keep out |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Rerun | Truth/blueprint separation; nested Grid, Horizontal, Vertical, and Tabs containers; editable, file-backed, default and heuristic layouts | Using application-id coupling as Mere's space identity; Mere spaces can deliberately compose several graphs |
| `egui_tiles` | Generic payloads, recursive containers, grid movement, drag/drop, garbage collection, and explicit simplification rules | Making a runtime UI tree durable authority before Turnstone proves serialization and mixed-surface routing |
| Zellij | Named nested layouts; tiled/stacked/floating stations; [pane identity and pin/show/hide operations](https://zellij.dev/documentation/plugin-api-commands) | Treating a terminal scrollback buffer as the semantic shell transcript; allowing floats to become a second copy of a tiled pane |

## 2. Live contradictions

### 2.1 Graph identity exists in the model and is dropped by the host

Every `PaneNode::Leaf` already carries `graph_id`, and
`retag_graph_bound_from` explicitly preserves a second graph pane
([src/panes/layout.rs](../src/panes/layout.rs)). The current host then loses the
binding:

- `App` owns one `canvas` and one current `session_id`
  ([src/app/mod.rs](../src/app/mod.rs)).
- Session adoption replaces the canvas graph in place
  ([src/app/session_lifecycle.rs](../src/app/session_lifecycle.rs)).
- `PanePlacement` carries pane id, content, and rect, but not `graph_id`
  ([src/pane.rs](../src/pane.rs)).
- Every Orrery leaf becomes the same `SurfaceKind::Canvas`, with one fixed
  `SurfaceId::CANVAS` ([src/surface.rs](../src/surface.rs)).
- A lens borrows the same canvas and temporarily swaps only its viewport
  ([src/shell/lens.rs](../src/shell/lens.rs)).

Two Orrery leaves can therefore duplicate one canvas view, but cannot present two
independent graphs. The old Mere pool is precedent, not current Turnstone proof.

### 2.2 Pane identity exists and renderer state is keyed by kind

`summon_pane` mints a fresh `PaneId` on every summon
([src/app/pane_arms.rs](../src/app/pane_arms.rs)), while the shell retains one
Roster, Gloss, Trail, Inspector, Workbench, Apparatus, Settings, and Publishing
runner ([src/shell/mod.rs](../src/shell/mod.rs)). Sharing one runner across a pane's
tear-out stations preserves identity. Sharing it across two distinct pane ids
does not.

### 2.3 Pane registration is distributed

`PaneKind`, `PaneContent`, `pane_content`, labels, palette rows, render arms, input
arms, observation, and accessibility all repeat pane-kind knowledge. Settings and
Publishing use `Custom("settings")` and `Custom("publishing")`; layout mutation uses
`Custom("__placeholder__")`; `System` has no live constructor.

### 2.4 The Workbench and chrome are app-global

Turnstone holds one `App.workbench`, so two Workbench panes cannot own different
member arrangements. The omnibar likewise queries one `App::canvas`; its width and
top offset are constants, and only the primary window renders it
([src/ui.rs](../src/ui.rs), [src/chrome_view.rs](../src/chrome_view.rs)). Application
settings already name `shellbar_edge` and `shellbar_hidden`, but Turnstone does not
apply them.

### 2.5 `AppEvent` is not shell scrollback

`AppEvent` is a useful semantic observation stream, but it is partial, drained each
frame, and frequently carries display text without command identity, target context,
correlation, or a typed result ([src/observe.rs](../src/observe.rs)). A visible shell
transcript can consume those events; it cannot truthfully be a direct view over the
current stream.

## 3. Separate source, context, and view state

The earlier model overloaded `PaneBinding` with three different questions. The
replacement keeps them distinct:

```rust
struct PaneSpec {
    id: PaneId,
    kind: PaneKindId,
    source: PaneSource,          // what this pane presents
    context: ContextBinding,     // what this pane follows
    config: PaneConfig,          // durable per-instance configuration
}

struct PaneRecord {
    spec: PaneSpec,
    view: PaneViewState,         // pane-local camera, selection, scroll, UI state
}

enum PaneSource {
    Fixed(SourceRef),
    FromContext(SourceSelector),
}

enum SourceRef {
    Graph(GraphId),
    Forme { graph: GraphId, forme: FormeId },
    Member { graph: GraphId, member: GraphMemberId },
    Settings(SettingsRef),
    Session(SessionId),
    SessionSet,
    Application,
    External {
        schema: SourceSchemaId,
        payload: SerializedSource,
    },
}

enum SourceSelector {
    Graph,
    Forme,
    Member,
    Session,
}

enum ContextBinding {
    Own,
    Follow(PaneId),
    FocusedInOwnSpace,
    Application,
}
```

The exact Rust shapes may narrow during A0. The separation is the requirement.

### Context publication

A focused pane publishes the context it can honestly supply:

```rust
struct PaneContext {
    graph: Option<GraphId>,
    forme: Option<FormeId>,
    member: Option<GraphMemberId>,
    session: Option<SessionId>,
}
```

- A Graph pane publishes its graph and selected member.
- A Workbench publishes its graph and active member.
- A pinned member pane publishes its graph and member.
- Overmap publishes the selected session.
- Application surfaces publish no graph context.

`FocusedInOwnSpace` resolves to the most recently focused pane in the pane's current
space that publishes the needed field. Moving or tearing out the follower therefore
changes its focus scope without rewriting a stored `SpaceId`. `Follow(pane)` remains
attached to one context source. A following Roster, for example, uses
`PaneSource::FromContext(SourceSelector::Graph)` with `FocusedInOwnSpace`; pinning it
resolves that pair to `PaneSource::Fixed(SourceRef::Graph(id))` with `Own`.

The omnibar captures a context snapshot when it opens. A later focus movement cannot
silently redirect a command that is already being composed.

### Graph authority and Graph pane

Graph truth and projected arrangement are runtimes, not panes — the same
split the platform later ruled wing-wide (2026-08-28, the consolidation map
in mere's `2026-08-22_conatus_engine_plan.md`): realms own truth, projection
shows them, and physics is a stratified capacity living in projection space
here (Forme) exactly as seiche does on the canvas:

```rust
GraphRuntimePool: HashMap<GraphId, GraphRuntime>
FormeRuntimePool: HashMap<(GraphId, FormeId), FormeRuntime>
```

`GraphRuntime` owns graph truth and graph-scoped live resources. `FormeRuntime` owns
arrangement geometry and its physics, with shared geometry addressed inside it by
projection kind and layout id. A Graph pane owns a `PaneId`, camera, selection, and
other view intent. Two panes may show:

- two different graphs, using two runtimes;
- one graph through independent cameras and selections;
- one graph through a shared `FormeId` geometry;
- explicit arrangement forks, using different `FormeId` values.

The identity Orrery arrangement is computed from graph truth. It is not persisted as
if it were a curated Workbench. Curated member arrangements and explicit Forme forks
are durable; projection geometry may be rebuilt from them.

`SurfaceKind::Graph(PaneId)` replaces the singleton canvas surface. Render, input,
accessibility, content routing, and commands resolve the pane first, then its graph.

### Session rule

A session remains a durable graph-shaped unit with `SessionId -> root GraphId`.
A space may reference several sessions and graph runtimes at once. Focus chooses the
default target for switch, save, rename, and navigation actions. Overmap continues to
derive the session set from manifests. Broader cross-session relations stay with the
Overmap and murm/moot owners.

This minimum rule is owned here because a two-graph receipt cannot be implemented
while `App::session_id` still means the only graph allowed in memory.

## 4. The Workbench

The Workbench is a graph-bound desk: a durable, curated arrangement of graph members
promoted into directly usable content surfaces. It answers which members are open,
how they are split or stacked, and which member is active. It does not replace graph
truth or the window layout.

Platen already owns a recursive split tree of member tab-stacks and projects it onto
`genet-host-api::TileTree`
([Platen README](../../mere/crates/platen/platen/README.md),
[workbench.rs](../../mere/crates/platen/platen/src/workbench.rs)). Turnstone currently
hosts that tree inside one Workbench pane and composites live document surfaces into
its cells ([src/workbench_pane.rs](../src/workbench_pane.rs)).

The durable relationship is:

```text
GraphId
  -> FormeId / Workbench arrangement
       -> Workbench pane view
            -> member tiles and document surfaces
```

A window blueprint stores the Workbench pane and its
`PaneSource::Fixed(SourceRef::Forme { graph, forme })` source. The member arrangement
stays with the Forme/Workbench store. Closing its last pane makes the arrangement
dormant; reopening it restores the same member tree.

### Shared topology, separate authority

The useful generalization is a topology algebra parameterized by leaf identity:

```text
window composition  = LayoutTree<PaneId>
workbench content   = LayoutTree<MemberRef>
```

They may share split, tab, grid, drag, fraction, and normalization code. They do not
share ids, registries, or persistence owners. A Workbench member tile is pane-shaped
and may render as its own surface, but it is not a registered window pane.

The current hard sentence "Workbench cells are not panes" is therefore refined:
they are nested layout leaves keyed by graph-member identity rather than top-level
pane identity.

## 5. Space topology, nesting, and floats

```rust
struct SpaceBlueprint {
    panes: Vec<PaneSpec>,
    tiled: LayoutNode,
    floating: Vec<FloatingPane>,
    chrome: ChromeBlueprint,
}

enum LayoutNode {
    Pane(PaneId),
    Split {
        axis: Axis,
        children: Vec<LayoutBranch>,
    },
    Tabs {
        children: Vec<LayoutNode>,
        active: usize,
    },
    Grid {
        children: Vec<LayoutNode>,
        columns: GridColumns,
        shares: GridShares,
    },
}
```

Containers recurse, so nested splits and tabbed sublayouts are ordinary structure.
The model must define normalization after every edit: empty containers disappear,
single-child containers collapse according to policy, adjacent same-axis splits may
join, fractions renormalize, and focus moves to a surviving neighbor. The policy is
saved with or derived from the named layout, not scattered through gesture handlers.

### Nested panes

Three cases must keep different names:

1. A recursively nested **container** holds ordinary pane leaves.
2. A **layout-host pane**, currently Workbench, renders a second tree whose leaves use
   another identity type.
3. A pane containing another arbitrary `SpaceBlueprint` is a future embedded space.
   It waits for a real second consumer beyond Workbench.

### Floating panes

A float is the same `PaneId` presented outside the tiled tree:

```rust
struct FloatingPane {
    pane: PaneId,
    rect: RelativeRect,
    z: u32,
    pinned: bool,
    visible: bool,
}
```

Each `PaneId` occupies exactly one station across all live spaces: one tiled leaf or
one floating entry. Floating is a change of station, not a second appearance.

Docking, floating, and tearing out relocate one pane instance. They do not clone its
runtime. Floats are scoped to a space, composite above the tiled root, and below
modal chrome. Clicking raises a float. A pinned float stays visible when the float
layer is toggled. Geometry supports proportional and absolute constraints so a
layout survives window resizing.

### The `TileTree` decision

The existing `genet-host-api::TileTree` is more capable than Turnstone's binary
split tree in some ways, but it is not the complete target above:

- it has N-ary row/column splits and leaf tab-stacks;
- tab-stacks contain tiles, not arbitrary child subtrees;
- it has no grid or float layer;
- its current types are runtime presentation values rather than serde persistence;
- its own module contract says Mere projects Forme onto it rather than making it
  arrangement truth.

A0 therefore defines the required topology before choosing the reused type. A4 must
prove one of these outcomes:

1. Extend the shared contract because Pelt and Turnstone both consume the added
   topology without importing Mere semantics; or
2. Keep Turnstone's serializable `SpaceBlueprint` authoritative and project it onto
   `TileTree` where Cambium furniture benefits; or
3. Keep the Turnstone presenter and tree independent while sharing only split/tab
   state math.

The mixed-surface compositor remains Turnstone-owned in every outcome.

## 6. Pane registry and taxonomy

```rust
struct PaneDefinition {
    id: PaneKindId,
    display_name: &'static str,
    source_shape: SourceShape,
    uniqueness: Uniqueness,
    capabilities: PaneCapabilities,
    default_placement: PlacementPolicy,
    config_schema: PaneConfigSchema,
    config_codec: PaneConfigCodec,
    view_persistence: ViewPersistencePolicy,
    renderer_factory: RendererFactory,
}

enum Uniqueness {
    Many,
    PerSpace,
    PerSpaceAndSource,
    PerSpaceAndContext,
}
```

Each definition owns the typed config schema, default, and encode/decode boundary
for its pane kind. `PaneConfig` is not a universal untyped property bag.
`PaneSource` names content authority rather than repeating pane kind; the
definition's `source_shape` validates which source forms that kind accepts.

Initial rulings:

| Pane | Plain job | Source/context | Uniqueness |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Graph / Orrery | Spatial graph view and context source | fixed Forme | Many |
| Workbench | Curated member workspace and context source | fixed Forme | Many |
| Tile | One pinned member surface | fixed member | Many |
| Gloss | Graph navigator and projection | graph context; per-instance composition | Many |
| Roster | Graph manifest | graph context | Per space and context |
| Inspector | Addressed-content identity and diagnostics | member context | Per space and context |
| Apparatus | Selected object's facets and representation | member context | Per space and context |
| Trail | Navigation chronology | graph/session context | Per space and context |
| Alembic | Durable memory and engrams | application/persona source | Per space and source |
| Steward | Operational activity | application/space source | Per space |
| Comms | Conversation | place/session source | Per space and source |
| Overmap | Session set and lineage | session-set source | Per space |
| Publishing | Publishing workflow | explicit target source | Many |
| Settings | Provider-described configuration | `Settings(SettingsRef)` | Per space and source |

`System` is removed. `Custom(String)` becomes a namespaced `External` source whose
schema owns decoding and validation. The layout placeholder becomes an internal
`LayoutNode` edit state rather than a fake pane. `PaneKind` retires; the registry
supplies labels, palette entries, availability, capabilities, uniqueness, and
renderer creation.

Renderer state is keyed by `PaneId`. Tear-out preserves the id. Closing the pane
evicts the retained runner; restore rebuilds it lazily.

## 7. Shell services, chrome, and scrollback

Chrome is not the pane tree, its dividers, or graph content. It is the visual
projection of shell services above or beside the space:

- omnibar and command providers;
- focus and command targeting;
- navigation controls;
- notifications and transient status;
- layout editing affordances;
- shell transcript projections.

The shell owns the data and actions. `ChromeBlueprint` decides which projections
exist and where they appear.

```rust
struct ChromeBlueprint {
    omnibar: OmnibarPlacement,
    shellbar: Option<ShellbarLayout>,
    transcript: TranscriptPlacement,
    status: StatusPlacement,
}
```

Placements may be summoned overlay, docked edge, floating pane, ordinary pane, or
hidden. Application settings choose defaults and shortcuts. A named space blueprint
stores the actual composition. Per-space transient state such as open/closed, current
query, selection, and scroll offset stays outside the reusable blueprint.

### Shell transcript

The transcript is a typed, bounded record of intentional shell interaction, rather
than a tracing console:

```rust
struct ShellEntry {
    id: ShellEntryId,
    input: ShellInput,
    resolved_intent: Option<ShellIntent>,
    target: ContextSnapshot,
    outcome: ShellOutcome,
    timestamp: Timestamp,
    privacy: EntryPrivacy,
}
```

`AppEvent` and asynchronous updates enrich entries through correlation ids. They are
also usable independently by diagnostics and automation. Steward keeps operational
status; Comms keeps conversation; the Shell Transcript keeps the user's command,
navigation, and result history.

The transcript can project as recent omnibar history, a docked Command Log, a
floating pane, or an ordinary pane. Entries may be copied, repeated, or opened at
their original target. Retention and persistence are configurable. Storage is local
by default; providers redact secret-bearing input before it reaches the ledger.

## 8. Settings

Settings remains addressed configuration content:

- `PaneSource::Fixed(SourceRef::Settings(settings_ref))` selects the provider and
  page;
- `ContextBinding` states whether the page follows a context or remains application
  scoped;
- the configured product owns typed values and storage;
- `SettingsProvider` describes and applies them;
- Cambium renders controls from `SettingControl` rather than setting ids.

Turnstone's current provider still uses `pelt/appearance`, exposes only theme id,
theme mode, and zoom, and marks them `Live` without updating the running shell
([src/settings_provider.rs](../src/settings_provider.rs),
[src/settings_pane.rs](../src/settings_pane.rs)). The first completion slice corrects
the namespace and makes every advertised `Live` value observable immediately.

Apparatus remains object-facing. Diagnostics remain outside settings. Presentation
as tab, pane, float, or modal is a chrome/layout preference over one Settings source.

## 9. Persistence ownership

| State | Owner and storage |
| --- | --- |
| Graph truth and graph-scoped runtime metadata | Session/graph stores keyed by `GraphId` |
| Forme identity, lifecycle, and curated Workbench member arrangement | Durable Forme/Workbench store keyed by `(GraphId, FormeId)` |
| Identity Orrery arrangement | Computed from graph truth rather than copied into a window blueprint |
| Shared projection geometry and physics | `FormeRuntime`, addressed by `(FormeId, projection kind, layout id)` and rebuilt from graph/Forme truth |
| Graph-pane camera, selection, and view intent | Live `PaneRecord` keyed by `PaneId`; the pane definition decides which fields snapshot into a blueprint |
| Pane source, follower rule, and instance configuration | `PaneSpec` in `SpaceBlueprint` |
| Tiled topology and floats | `workbench::Workspace`, serialized by Turnstone as the saved layout (A4 as revised 2026-09-04; was `SpaceBlueprint`) |
| Chrome composition | `SpaceBlueprint`'s `ChromeBlueprint`, until A6/A8 place it |
| Application shell defaults and settings | Application settings provider |
| Shell transcript | Bounded local transcript store under explicit retention policy |

Rerun's lesson applies directly: truth and blueprint are independently useful. A
layout can be saved, shared, reset, or heuristically regenerated without editing a
graph or Workbench arrangement. A Workbench source in a portable blueprint may name
a role such as "focused graph's default workbench" rather than exporting a private
local `FormeId`.

The repository is pre-alpha. The first registry/layout format may replace existing
`frame.json`; unreadable legacy layouts fall back to a logged default. Graph,
Workbench, settings, and transcript stores are not discarded with it.

## 10. Implementation gates

### A0. Pure model and inventory

**Completed 2026-08-09.** The live pane audit is recorded in
[Pane Inventory](2026-08-09_pane_inventory.md). The rendering-free model lives in
`src/panes/blueprint.rs`; focused tests prove context resolution and pinning,
recursive normalization, tiled-to-floating relocation, cross-space movement,
global pane-station uniqueness, Forme/graph validation, and serialization.

- Inventory every current pane's source, published context, follower rule,
  uniqueness, instance state, capabilities, renderer, persistence, and evidence.
- Define `PaneSpec`, `PaneRecord`, `PaneSource`, `ContextBinding`, `PaneContext`,
  `SpaceBlueprint`, normalization, and focus resolution as data-only types.
- Add model tests for nested containers, focus-derived context, pinning, float moves,
  cross-space PaneId uniqueness, normalization, and serde round trips.

Done when graph/source/context/multiplicity are explicit and no rendering code is
needed to prove the state transitions.

### A1. Registry and instance correctness

**Complete and verified 2026-08-10.** The built-in registry now
owns stable ids, labels, source validation, multiplicity, capabilities, palette
availability, schemas, legacy construction, and renderer keys. `PaneKind`, `System`,
magic custom-pane strings, and fake layout leaves have been removed. Retained
Cambium runners are keyed and lazily created by `PaneId`; closing a pane or lens
evicts only its instances. Focused model/registry tests pass. The full library
currently stops on unresolved Knot share-reader imports outside this lane, before
crate tests can execute.

- Register existing panes and retire `PaneKind`, `pane_content`, `System`, magic
  custom strings, and the fake placeholder.
- Use Publishing as the plain workflow proof.
- Key retained runners by `PaneId`; preserve ids across docking and tear-out; evict
  on close and rebuild lazily on restore.

Done when adding a Publishing-like pane requires one registration plus its renderer,
and two supported same-kind panes retain independent scroll, selection, and controls.


### Running the open lanes side by side

A2, A6, and A7 are independent by design, but the tree is not: several agents
already commit here, and this session watched work swept into the wrong commit
twice and a red test appear in a file no lane had touched. Three rules, cheap
to keep and expensive to retrofit:

- **Each lane owns its files.** A1 owns the landed external source identity;
  A2 owns the graph pool and graph surface runtime identity (`PaneId` and
  `graph_id`); A6 owns chrome, omnibar, and transcript; A7 owns Cambium
  components and settings. Port surface admission is tracked separately in
  `mere/design_docs/mere_docs/implementation_strategy/2026-08-24_knot_shared_surface_and_port_contribution_plan.md`.
  Where a lane must touch a shared file, it touches only its own items in it.
- **Commit your own paths, not the tree.** The whole-tree default is right for
  one agent and wrong for three. Where a sweep happens anyway, name what was
  swept in the message, as this repo already does.
- **A red test outside your lane is a report, not a task.** The current
  `publish_pane::tests::unavailable_panel_is_an_honest_configured_surface`
  failure belongs to the Shared Knot lane and is outstanding; it is not A2's to
  silence.
### A2. Graph runtime pool and two-graph composition

**Open.** A1, its dependency, is signed off.

This lane does not own port-provider factories, retained-session erasure,
command or settings contribution, or live capability facts. A contributed
surface depends on A2 only when it needs multi-graph context.

- Replace `App::canvas` and exclusive `session_id` routing with a graph runtime pool
  plus Forme runtimes and focused-space context.
- Carry `PaneId` and `graph_id` through placement, surface planning, render, input,
  content contributions, accessibility, commands, save, and observation.
- Replace singleton Canvas focus/surface identity with pane-addressed Graph surfaces.

Done when graph A and graph B render side by side in one window, both receive pointer
and keyboard input, graph A mutation leaves B unchanged, and restart restores both.

### A3. Multiple views and Workbenches

**Gated on A2.**

- Allow two Graph panes over one graph with independent cameras and selections.
- Create or reuse the `FormeRuntime` named by each Graph and Workbench pane's Forme
  source.
- Share geometry only when Forme, projection kind, and layout id agree; keep camera,
  selection, and other view intent keyed by `PaneId`.
- Key Workbench state by graph/Forme source instead of `App.workbench`.
- Publish context from Graph, Workbench, and member panes; make Roster and Inspector
  follow explicit or focused context.

Done when one graph appears through two independent views, two Workbenches can show
different arrangements, and Inspector follows the active member of the intended
Workbench rather than a global canvas.

### A4. Containers, tabs, and shared-tree decision

**Held** until A2/A3 report what the tree must carry. This is the tree
decision, not the tab decision: Turnstone's tree is binary, `TileTree` is
N-ary and recursive, and nested splits and nested panes both want that
recursion.

**Revised by Mark, 2026-09-04: outcome 1.** The 2026-08-11 decision below
kept a Turnstone-private topology because the shared contract could not own
mixed-surface routing, persistence, or stable pane identity. Mark's ruling:
those are the stack's to own, so the contract is extended rather than
worked around — `workbench` gains serde and the A5 float layer, Cambium's
`tab_strip` gains a close affordance, frisket gains a slot resolver, and a
`cambium::workspace` composition wires them. Turnstone then renders **one
frame per window**: its own panes as `Component`s in that frame, contributed
panes through the retained-surface trait, the graph canvas and WebViews as
holes it composites. Mark ruled one renderer over the first draft's
host-composited strip surfaces (2026-09-04): the host's own content is not
a hole. The user-facing result:
every tiled pane wears a tab bar (a one-tab stack is the sub-title bar), each
tab closes from its ×, panes stack by dragging one onto another, and the
layout is saved and restored. `SpaceBlueprint`, the binary `PaneNode` tree,
`legacy_bridge.rs` and `frame.json` retire; `Grid` is not ported, since
nothing constructs one. The stack half and the done-conditions live in
`mere/design_docs/cambium_docs/implementation_strategy/2026-08-31_workbench_component_plan.md`
(W5); the revisit trigger it fires is
`genet/docs/2026-07-24_frisket_pane_component_direction.md` follow-on §2.
Turnstone's half starts only after mere is pushed and this repository's
pin moves — Mark's steps.

**Decision, 2026-08-11: outcome 3 (superseded above).** `SpaceBlueprint` remains Turnstone's
serializable topology authority. `genet-host-api::TileTree` stays a useful
presentation donor for Cambium furniture, but it cannot own mixed GPU/document/
Cambium surface routing, persistence, stable pane identity, or the inactive-tab
lifecycle rule. Turnstone shares split state math where it helps and projects its
own active layout into the outer compositor and accessibility tree. No shared
contract is promoted until a second non-Mere host needs the whole topology.

- Prove nested N-ary splits and a tabbed subtree over mixed Graph, document, and
  Cambium surfaces.
- Compare the required `SpaceBlueprint` operations with `TileTree` and record outcome
  1, 2, or 3 from section 5.
- Keep inactive tabs out of render, hit testing, accessibility focus, and pumping
  unless their content lifecycle explicitly remains warm.

Done when a nested mixed-surface layout survives drag, resize, save, reload, and
tear-out, with one authoritative topology and the fallback recorded.

### A5. Floating layer

**Held** behind A4; floats layer onto whichever tree wins.

- Add float geometry, z-order, pinned visibility, focus raise, dock targets, and
  tear-out from a float.
- Reuse the same PaneId and renderer state through every station.

Done when one pane moves tile -> float -> nested split -> window and returns without
losing state or leaving an unreachable runner.

**Implemented 2026-08-12 (headed desktop receipt).** `SpaceBlueprint` owns
constrained proportional float geometry, per-space z-order, pin and visibility
policy, focus raise, dock targets, and transactional float tear-out. The legacy
Frisket layout is bridged one-way into that authority on the first float, and
the primary and lens compositors then project the live blueprint into their
surface plans. `scenarios/a5_floating_pane.scn` proves tile -> float -> nested
split -> lens -> return -> dock, retaining one `PaneId` and its renderer state;
it captures both spaces and drives real pointer focus raising. The receipt is
headed and passed on 2026-08-12.

Frisket still provides the existing leaf payload and at-rest layout path. Float
station topology and geometry remain transient until A8, so this is not yet a
persistence or raw drag-gesture proof.

### A6. Shell and configurable chrome

**Complete 2026-08-14.** 244 library tests pass.

This lane was marked Open in error. Most of it was already built when the
marking was made -- `ShellServices`, provider registry, shortcuts, omnibar
config, `ChromeBlueprint`, and a `ShellTranscript` with correlation, privacy,
retention and repeat -- and the marking came from reading this document rather
than the tree. Recorded because the same mistake was then made twice more
inside the lane: a `repeat_shell_entry` was written before discovering the one
that already existed, and a critique earlier in this plan asserted a reuse
target that the dependency graph forbade. Read the code before claiming a lane
is open.

Two clauses of the done-condition were genuinely unmet, and both are now
closed:

- **Nothing rendered the transcript.** Its `ChromePlacement` defaults to
  `Hidden` and no projection existed, so a command could not be "repeated from
  a docked or floating transcript" -- there was nothing to repeat it from.
  `transcript_pane` is that projection, registered through the registry as its
  second proof after Publishing (one registration plus a renderer), and wired
  through render, input, and the probe driver. Five receipts, two of them about
  restraint rather than capability: a pending entry is inert, because repeating
  a command whose first run has not landed doubles an effect by accident; and a
  redacted entry's text cannot be found by the resolver a scenario runner aims
  with, which is a stronger claim than not printing it.
- **Chrome never proved it restores.** Every blueprint test built
  `ChromeBlueprint::default()`, so the field rode through serde with no test
  able to tell a restored composition from a fresh default. Pinned now with
  four deliberately different placements.

Left for whoever takes chrome further, and deliberately not built here: the
transcript projects only as an ordinary pane. `Docked`, `Floating`, and
`Overlay` placements are declared in `ChromeBlueprint` and honoured by
`ShellChromeConfig`, but no host code positions a docked or floating transcript
yet, and floats as a structure belong to A5.

- Split shell service state from Chrome projections.
- Add provider registration and configurable omnibar placement, row limit, default
  scope, shortcuts, shellbar edge/visibility, and transcript placement.
- Add `ShellTranscript` with correlation, privacy, retention, and repeat/open actions.

Done when a command captures its original pane context, produces one correlated
result entry, can be repeated from a docked or floating transcript, and the chrome
composition restores from a named layout.

### A7. Cambium and Settings completion

**Open.** Self-contained; runs beside A2 and A6.

- Promote pane shell/header, settings form, empty/error/unavailable state, and the
  relevant Frisket specimens into Cambium's component catalog.
- Correct the Turnstone Settings namespace and render generically from
  `SettingControl`.
- Connect every `Live` setting to the running host; label restart/startup settings
  honestly.

Done when catalog specimens cover narrow and regular layouts, Turnstone consumes
them, theme/zoom/shell placement change live, and values survive relaunch.

### A8. Named blueprints

- Save, load, duplicate, rename, reset-to-default, and reset-to-heuristic layouts.
- Keep private ids out of portable exports; resolve role-based sources on import.
- Preserve graph, Workbench, Settings, and transcript stores across layout changes.

Done when Browse, Inspect, and Operate are editable examples rather than modes, and a
layout can be shared or reset without changing graph/session truth.

## 11. Stop rules

- Keep Turnstone's mixed-surface compositor as the outer presenter.
- Treat graph authority, Graph pane view state, Workbench arrangement, and window
  blueprint as separate owners even when they share tree or surface primitives.
- Keep PaneId stable across dock, float, and tear-out; use member identity inside a
  Workbench.
- Require a second consumer before promoting arbitrary embedded-space hosting or new
  shared topology into Genet.
- Keep `AppEvent` useful for observation; create a correlated transcript rather than
  changing it into a UI store.
- Keep generated proof outputs on disk and outside Git.
- Stop a shared-`TileTree` migration if it cannot preserve mixed-surface rendering,
  persistence, instance identity, and input authority in one completed proof.

## 12. Deferred decisions

- Write-side third-party pane registration through the participant gate.
- Stored cross-session Overmap relations beyond manifest-derived lineage.
- Persisting and restoring versioned contributed `PaneSource` values and their
  user-configurable settings. T5a's Sky source is intentionally immutable
  opening provenance; its valid draft survives only for the retained pane's
  current process lifetime.
- Product display-name changes such as Canvas versus Orrery and Navigator versus
  Gloss.
- Default layout details. Defaults remain editable and user-configurable.

## Progress

- 2026-09-04: A4 revised to outcome 1 on Mark's ruling, from a screen full of
  panes with no way to close them: the pane frame becomes Workbench's tree
  with tabs, floats and serde, and Cambium's strip gets the close ×. The
  reasons outcome 3 gave are now the stack's work list. Also found this
  session, in a file the physics receipts touched: the `wait` verb returned
  before the layout settled because `busy` never asked the canvas; fixed in
  `39339e8`.

- 2026-08-26: the Sky T5a consumer exercised the generic contributed-pane path
  with a second concrete provider. Per-`PaneId` retention and versioned source
  admission are proven. Restart restoration of the source remains an A8
  blueprint/persistence concern rather than product-owned state in the Sky
  session.

- 2026-08-24: corrected the port-contribution accounting. A1 already owns the
  namespaced `External` source identity; A2 remains the graph runtime pool and
  `PaneId` / `graph_id` propagation lane. The shared Knot plan owns provider
  description, admission, and retained-session erasure.

- 2026-08-16 (multiplicity, found by looking at a screenshot): Device Receipts
  was registered `PaneMultiplicity::Many` while sourced from
  `FixedSourceKind::Application`. There is exactly one application, so a second
  pane could only ever render identical content, and because `summon_pane`
  deliberately skips the dedupe for `Many` kinds, every "Open Device Receipts
  pane" split the active pane and added another copy. Seven were reachable in
  one window. Now `PerSpace`, matching Steward, which is the only other
  `Application`-sourced pane and was already correct.

  **The rule the table now states consistently:** multiplicity has to agree
  with the source shape. A pane whose source is fixed to a singleton
  (`Application`, `SessionSet`) is `PerSpace` at most; `Many` is for panes
  whose source distinguishes instances (`Member`, `External(..)`, a `Forme` a
  reader may legitimately want two views of). The remaining `Many` rows all
  pass that test: Orrery and Workbench over `Forme`, Tile over `Member`,
  Publishing over a target, Shared Knot over a ticket.

  Worth keeping about how this surfaced: the duplicate panes were visible in a
  headed capture taken for an unrelated receipt, and went unremarked because
  the capture was being read for the one row it was taken to prove. The cost of
  the duplicates was separately real (see the layout retention entry in
  [`2026-07-15_turnstone_surfaces_in_cambium.md`](2026-07-15_turnstone_surfaces_in_cambium.md):
  each copy cost 24 ms a frame).

  Still open, and named here rather than left implicit: **a pane has no close
  affordance.** `Action::CloseActivePane` exists, reachable as the palette row
  "Close pane" and scriptable as `close_pane`, and it acts on the active pane.
  There is no control on the pane itself, no keybinding, and nothing marks
  which pane is active, so with several panes open there is no way to tell
  which one is about to close.
