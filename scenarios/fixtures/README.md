# Scenario fixtures

Packs the scenarios and tests install as participants.

- `trail_keeper.lua` — a rung-1 control script (the piccolo lane).
- `app_core_guest.wasm` — an `app-core` component (the envelope lane), built
  from mere's `crates/script/app-host/guest`. Rebuild it with:

  ```
  cd <mere>/crates/script/app-host/guest
  cargo build --target wasm32-wasip2 --release
  cp target/wasm32-wasip2/release/app_core_guest.wasm <turnstone>/scenarios/fixtures/
  ```

  It is committed so the wasm lane's receipts run on any checkout without a
  wasm toolchain. mere's own `app-host` tests build it from source, so a WIT
  change that breaks it fails there first.
