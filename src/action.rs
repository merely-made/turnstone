//! The one vocabulary: everything that acts on turnstone lowers to an
//! [`Action`]; everything slow or platform-shaped leaves [`crate::app`] as an
//! [`Effect`] the shell runs through a port; services answer with an
//! [`Update`] drained on wake. Settings, automation, scenarios, scripting,
//! and remote control all speak this vocabulary, so no lane grows a second
//! execution model (the architecture plan's doctrine 2 — the meerkat
//! `command_drain` lesson).
//!
//! Two deliberate boundaries:
//!
//! * **The gesture law.** Ephemeral interaction may bypass Action: the
//!   canvas's semantic input methods (`pointer_down`, `cursor_moved`,
//!   `wheel`, ...) are already a typed vocabulary at the right granularity,
//!   and the shell maps raw input onto them directly. Durable or externally
//!   observable semantic change may not bypass — a gesture that ends in one
//!   surfaces a semantic event at gesture end. `Action` is the app-intent
//!   tier (navigate, reseed, flip a view mode), the tier automation and
//!   commands speak.
//! * **Port-agnostic messages.** This module never imports a service crate:
//!   [`Update`] carries app-owned types, and each port's adapter
//!   ([`crate::browse`] for the fetch actor) converts the service's concrete
//!   types at the boundary. The universal vocabulary must not depend on one
//!   port implementation.
