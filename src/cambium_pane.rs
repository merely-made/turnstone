//! The cambium seam: a cambium view rendered into a turnstone pane surface, and
//! the pane's pointer events routed back into it. Rung 5 slice D, the toolkit
//! adoption.
//!
//! cambium builds a `ScriptedDom` — the exact type turnstone's chrome already lays
//! out through genet-layout into a paint list — so a cambium view drops into the
//! compose-at-surface-rect seam slice A built. A `GenetAppRunner` holds the view's
//! state and renders it into a `DomHandle`; turnstone composites that DOM, and
//! routes a pane-local click back through genet-layout's hit test into
//! `dispatch_click`, which returns the Actions the view emitted. Those lower
//! through turnstone's ordinary spine — the same path a keypress takes.
//!
//! That round trip (render -> composite -> hit-test -> dispatch -> Action) is the
//! general pane-event path every cambium pane reuses; the Roster's `data_grid` is
//! its first consumer. Turnstone is cambium's first pixel host, so this integration
//! is new: the catalog example is a headless acceptance test.
