//! The wasm denizen lane: an `app-core` component acting on turnstone through
//! the action ENVELOPE, ring-gated at every emission.
//!
//! This is the second face of the ONE grant (participant gate B2/B3): the
//! piccolo lane derives `ScriptCapabilities` from the denizen's authority,
//! and this lane checks the same authority per emission via [`crate::ring`].
//! Neither lane carries a feature flag that decides what a denizen may do —
//! the grant decides, and the review is where a grant comes from.
//!
//! The sink COLLECTS rather than applying: a host function cannot hold
//! `&mut App` while the app sits inside a wasm call. So an allowed emission
//! is queued, and the caller lowers the queue through the ordinary Action
//! spine after the turn, with the journal scoped to the denizen's subject —
//! exactly the shape `RunDenizen` already uses for piccolo.
