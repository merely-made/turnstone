//! Denizen residency (participant gate B1, the turnstone half): install a local
//! scenario pack as a resident helper, review its grant visibly, run it from
//! the palette, and read its edits back attributed.
//!
//! The substrate is already built and this module only wires it: the node IS
//! the denizen (the `denizen.binding` facet carries subject + kind — agency;
//! the world it bears hangs on `Node.nested` — structure, the kernel's
//! `GraphBearing` impl), its inner world is a chartulary `GraphLog` the `servitor::Gate`
//! commits into (grant projections read-only, petitions attributed and
//! revision-checked), and its runnable body is a piccolo control script whose
//! emitted Actions lower through the ordinary spine — under the denizen's
//! author in mere's attributed `GraphJournal`.
//!
//! Identity: the subject is **content-derived** — `blake3(source)` is the
//! 32-byte keyholder — so the same script is the same denizen everywhere, and
//! a modified script is a different subject facing a fresh grant review.
//! (Signed personae subjects arrive with packs at B4; the gate does not care
//! which mints the bytes.)
