//! The observation surface: one snapshot + one event stream over app truth
//! (the architecture plan's recorded snapshot/events pair, landed at its
//! trigger — the scenario lane is the first automation consumer, and its
//! asserts read THIS surface instead of poking app fields one by one). The
//! same surface is what the a11y projection, diagnostics, and the
//! session-engines plan's automation story consume later: observation is
//! the vocabulary's other half, so it lives beside `action`, app-owned and
//! port-agnostic.
//!
//! Scope note: events are emitted where Actions and Updates fold — the
//! semantic tier. Continuous gestures bypass Action by the gesture law, so
//! a gesture-end semantic change (click-selection, drag-placement) does not
//! yet emit; that arrives with the gesture-end events the law already
//! promises, not by teaching this module about pointers.
