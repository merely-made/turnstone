//! Turnstone's pane model: a savable tree of resizable panes, projected into a
//! uxtree subtree.
//!
//! **Was the `frisket` crate; folded in here 2026-07-25.** Two reasons. It had
//! exactly one consumer, so it wanted no package identity: a crate buys
//! compile-enforced boundaries and costs version drift, patch tables, and a name
//! to defend, while a module costs nothing. And the name went to
//! `cambium::frisket`, the family's shared pane *frame*, so keeping it on a
//! turnstone crate would have collided with a component turnstone consumes.
//!
//! What is here is deliberately NOT that frame. Turnstone places **one composited
//! surface per pane** (`shell::surface_plan`), which is how a live WebView, the
//! Orrery's GPU canvas, and a cambium-rendered pane coexist in one window; the
//! cambium frame renders one DOM with content holes instead. The two share what
//! is genuinely one idea, the split geometry (`cambium::Split`'s state math,
//! adopted 2026-07-17), and diverge on presentation on purpose. This tree is
//! turnstone's own pane authority, the analog of forme in mere.
//!
//! Its history before that: renamed from `frame` (2026-07-14), which was
//! overloaded three ways in this family (a rendered frame, a `TileFrame`, a
//! window's pane arrangement) and which also fused in the workspace id
//! vocabulary. The ids live in `incipit`.
//!
//! The tiers, which nest rather than compete:
//!
//! - `frisket` is pane-ness: kinds, ids, the split tree, the persisted layout.
//! - `platen` tiles graph nodes *inside* one [`PaneContent::Workbench`] leaf.
//! - The host turns this ratio tree into rects. Frisket emits no geometry.
//!
//! Split across submodules to keep each file under the workspace's
//! 600-LOC ceiling: [`layout`] holds the [`FrisketLayout`] operations
//! ([`FrisketLayout::summon_leaf`], `reparent_leaf`, `close_leaf`, …);
//! [`projection`] holds [`project_frisket`] + [`project_frisket_with`].
//!
