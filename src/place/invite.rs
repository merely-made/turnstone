//! The place invitation envelope.
//!
//! This is a host envelope, never a certificate. Holding one, forwarding one,
//! or parsing one successfully grants nothing: it names a place and carries the
//! artifacts an admission check needs, and every one of those artifacts is
//! verified by its own domain before anything is persisted.
//!
//! Everything here is data and bounds. The admission decision lives in the
//! worker, where Gemot and Stickleback can actually answer.
//!
//! **Delivery is not evidence.** An invitation may reasonably arrive over a
//! Murm thread with someone the user already knows and trusts, over a pasted
//! link, or over a radio carrier. None of that changes admission: the five
//! checks are identical, and a trusted sender shortcuts none of them. This is
//! structural rather than a rule to remember, because `admit_invitation` takes
//! no channel, peer, or session argument. There is nowhere for delivery trust
//! to enter it, and there should remain nowhere.
