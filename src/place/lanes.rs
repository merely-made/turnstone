//! Turnstone's live-lane composition: dial a ticket, hold seven handles.
//!
//! The shell-owned counterpart to the domain join helpers. Everything here is
//! composition: the transport crate owns dialing and overlay tagging, Gemot
//! owns its five lanes, Commons owns graph and chat, and this module only
//! decides what a *place* joins and in what order it lets go. Session and
//! transport identity never become content authority; every accept closure
//! runs the owning domain's admission, and projections stay
//! authority-filtered exactly as they are offline.
