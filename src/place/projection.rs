//! The shared graph, as the app sees it.
//!
//! Between the authority-filtered Commons fold and the Canvas a person looks
//! at. Data only: addresses and labels, no store handles, no operations, no
//! keys. What arrives here has already passed the authority filter, so
//! nothing pending or revoked can reach a surface through this path.
//!
//! ## Why reconciliation is additive
//!
//! A session's Canvas is the person's own workspace. Shared nodes arrive into
//! it, but the two are not the same graph and the shared side is not
//! authoritative over the local one: it decides what the *place* holds, never
//! what this person's canvas holds. So reconciliation adds what is missing and
//! marks what is shared, and never removes, moves, or relabels a node the
//! person put there. A shared node that disappears from the place stops being
//! marked as shared; it does not vanish from under the cursor.
