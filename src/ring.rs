//! The action-ring classifier: the envelope lane's permission model.
//!
//! A wasm (or any future) denizen emits actions through ONE stable envelope
//! (`mere:script`'s `actions` interface — `{name, payload}`), and the whole
//! `Action` surface is potentially emittable: no curated interface, no second
//! compile-time authority. What decides is the action's **ring** — a
//! capability-path family the emission classifies into — checked against the
//! denizen's grant at the moment of emission, exactly where the piccolo lane
//! already denies (B2: capability from the grant, not a feature flag).
//!
//! Rings, mapped to grantable capabilities. Each is a servitor
//! [`Cap::Power`](servitor::Cap): a CLOSED set whose coverage is equality, so
//! adding a ring can never widen a grant already issued (the capability-model
//! round, 2026-07-23; as string prefixes, a grant on `app/nav` covered
//! `app/navigate`).
//!
//! - navigate — moving through content
//! - panes — window / pane / workbench arrangement
//! - dispatch — node + view edits, and the omnibar (the command surface)
//! - session — fork / switch / close / delete / recover
//! - **host-only** — NO grantable path exists. Gate management
//!   (install / confirm / cancel / run) can never be covered by any
//!   authority: a component confirming its own grant review would be
//!   self-escalation, so it is structurally impossible, not policy-denied.
//!
//! [`ring_of`] is an exhaustive match with NO catch-all: adding an `Action`
//! variant without classifying it is a compile error, never a silent default.
//! A default profile ("scenario packs come preselected with navigate")
//! shapes the install review's checkboxes; it never grants silently — the
//! visible review stays the only place an ask becomes a grant.
