//! The surface plan: the ordered list of composited surfaces, their rects, and
//! which one has focus. Rung 5 slice A.
//!
//! Before this module, `Shell::render` bound one full-window placement and
//! reused it for all three layers, and focus routing was the single boolean
//! `omnibar.open`. There was no surface list, no ids, no z-order, no rects. The
//! architecture plan booked this seam as "born minimal at rung 3"; it was not.
//! Every later rung-5 slice (panes, content input, a11y stitching) needs it, so
//! it is built first.
//!
//! Everything here is pure: rects, hit-testing, and focus resolution are
//! functions of app truth and the window size, with no GPU and no winit. The
//! shell rasterizes each surface's scene and composes it at the rect this module
//! computes; the geometry itself is testable headless, which is the whole point
//! of separating it from `shell.rs`.
